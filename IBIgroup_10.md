<!-- What will the following code's output be in sequence and explain why?
function printNumber(num) {

  console.log(num);

}


console.log(1);


setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);


setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);


console.log(4); -->


The output of the code will be:

```
1
4
2
3

```

Explanation:

01. `console.log(1);`: This line logs the number 1 to the console.

02. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);`: This line schedules the `printNumber` function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is set to 0, the callback is still placed in the event queue, and it will be executed after the current call stack is cleared. The value 2 is passed as an argument to the `printNumber` function.

03. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);`: This line schedules another `printNumber` function to be executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds. The value 3 is passed as an argument to the `printNumber` function.

04. `console.log(4);`: This line logs the number 4 to the console.

Now let's see the sequence of events:

  - The initial code execution starts from the top of the script.
  - `console.log(1);` logs the number 1 to the console. Output: `1`
  - `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);` schedules the `printNumber(2)` function to be executed after the current call stack is cleared. However, it's important to note that the delay of 0 milliseconds doesn't mean it will be executed immediately; it's still placed in the event queue.
  - `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);` schedules the `printNumber(3)` function to be executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds. Since this comes after the previous `setTimeout`, it will execute after the 2nd one.
  - `console.log(4);` logs the number 4 to the console. Output: `1 4`
  - The current call stack is cleared, and now the functions in the event queue will be executed.
  - `printNumber(2)` is executed, and it logs the number 2 to the console. Output: `1 4 2`
  - `printNumber(3)` is executed after a delay of 100 milliseconds, and it logs the number 3 to the console. Output: `1 4 2 3`

So, the final output is: `1 4 2 3`
