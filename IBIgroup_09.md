<!-- What will the code below output to the console and why?

var arr1 = "john".split(''); 

var arr2 = arr1.reverse();

var arr3 = "jones".split('');

arr2.push(arr3);0

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1)); -->



The code will output the following to the console:

```
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
```

Explanation:

01. `var arr1 = "john".split('');`: This line creates an array `arr1` by splitting the string `"john"` into individual characters. So, `arr1` will be `["j", "o", "h", "n"]`.

02. `var arr2 = arr1.reverse();`: This line creates a new variable `arr2` and assigns it the reference to the same array `arr1`. The `reverse()` method is called on `arr1`, which reverses the array in place. Since both `arr1` and `arr2` reference the same array, the reverse operation affects both of them. So, `arr2` will also be `["n", "h", "o", "j"]`.

03. `var arr3 = "jones".split('');`: This line creates an array `arr3` by splitting the string `"jones"` into individual characters. So, `arr3` will be `["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"]`.

04. `arr2.push(arr3);`: This line pushes the array `arr3` as a single element to the end of `arr2`. After this operation, `arr2` will be `["n", "h", "o", "j", ["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"]]`. Note that `arr3` is treated as a single element because `push()` adds the entire array as a new element to the array.

05. `console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));`: This line logs the length of `arr1` (which is 5) and the last element of `arr1` (which is the array `["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"]`) to the console.

06. `console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));`: This line logs the length of `arr2` (which is 5) and the last element of `arr2` (which is the same array `["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"]`) to the console.

Since `arr1` and `arr2` reference the same array, any changes to one of them will be reflected in the other. That's why both `arr1` and `arr2` have the same content and length in the output.
