<!-- for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100)
  
  } -->

  The given code snippet will log the number 5 to the console five times, with a delay of 100 milliseconds between each log.

Explanation:

01. The code uses a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to 4 (inclusive) with the variable `i`.

02. Inside the loop, `setTimeout` is used to schedule the execution of an arrow function after a delay of 100 milliseconds. The arrow function's purpose is to log the current value of `i`.

03. Since the loop executes quickly, all five `setTimeout` calls are made almost simultaneously. However, each scheduled function will run after the specified delay (100 milliseconds). 

04. After the loop has finished execution, the value of `i` is 5 since the loop condition `i < 5` fails when `i` becomes 5, and the loop exits.

The output will be five occurrences of the number 5:

This happens because of how closures and scope work in JavaScript. When the 'setTimeout' function is called within the loop, it captures the reference to the variable 'i'. However, it does not create a separate copy of the value of 'i' for each iteration. Instead, all the scheduled functions share the same variable 'i'.

By the time the first function runs after a delay of 100 milliseconds, the loop has already finished executing, and the value of i is 5. When each scheduled function tries to log the value of i, it accesses the shared reference, and it will see that i is 5 for all of them.
