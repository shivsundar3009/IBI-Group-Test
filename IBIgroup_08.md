The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in the following order:

01. `console.log(1);` - This line logs the number 1 to the console immediately.

02. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);` - This line schedules a callback function to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). During this 1-second delay, the JavaScript engine continues executing the rest of the code.

03. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);` - This line also schedules a callback function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds. The delay of 0 milliseconds means that the callback is added to the event queue and will be executed as soon as the call stack is empty and all the synchronous code has finished executing. However, the `console.log(3)` call itself does not immediately log the number 3 to the console.

04. `console.log(4);` - This line logs the number 4 to the console immediately.

Now, let's see the order of execution:

01. `console.log(1);` logs "1" to the console immediately.

02. `console.log(4);` logs "4" to the console immediately.

03. `console.log(3)` - The callback function for this `setTimeout` is in the event queue and will be executed after the synchronous code has finished executing. At this point, the call stack is empty, so the callback is moved from the event queue to the call stack and logs "3" to the console.

04. `console.log(2)` - The callback function for this `setTimeout` is also in the event queue but has a delay of 1000 milliseconds. Since there is no other synchronous code to execute, the callback for this `setTimeout` moves from the event queue to the call stack after the 1-second delay and logs "2" to the console.

So, the final order of numbers logged to the console is: 1, 4, 3, 2.
